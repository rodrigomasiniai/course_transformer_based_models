# "Given a partial description like 'she opened the hood of the car,' humans can reason about the situation
# and anticipate what might come next ('then, she examined the engine').
# SWAG (Situations With Adversarial Generations) is a large-scale dataset for this task of grounded commonsense inference,
# unifying natural language inference and physically grounded reasoning.
# Each question is a video caption from LSMDC or ActivityNet Captions, with four answer choices
# about what might happen next in the scene. The correct answer is the (real) video caption for the next event in the video;
# the three incorrect answers are adversarially generated and human verified, so as to fool machines but not humans.
